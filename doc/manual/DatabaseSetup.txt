ExpressionTranslator assumes that the SQL database understands the generated
expressions.
We would like to have a world, where each database understands (at least)
the SQL 92 expressions.
But it is not the case.

e.g. MySQL 4.1.10
===========
does not understand  CAST(1 AS SQL_TEXT)
we must use CAST(1 AS CHAR)

does not understand "||" as string concatenation, just as a bit operator.
we must use concat(...) instead.

documentation says that
SET GLOBAL sql_mode='ANSI';
(same as SET GLOBAL sql_mode = 'REAL_AS_FLOAT,PIPES_AS_CONCAT,ANSI_QUOTES,IGNORE_SPACE';)
changes mysql to ANSI (=SQL 92?) mode.
But this is not fully true. (see above)

I did not dig deep, just at the surfice there allready is no standard.

e.g. MS Access
==============
o boy...
even DISTINCT does not work for result strings > 256 characters.
The strings are truncated!


Try some sql 92 expressions on your database:
=======================================
(CAST(1 AS SQL_TEXT) || '');
SET GLOBAL sql_mode='ANSI';
select @@global.sql_mode;
select ('a' || 'b');
select cast(1 as sql_text); 
select cast(10 as char);
select ('a' || 1);
select (1 || 'a');
select concat('a' , 'b' , 'c');
